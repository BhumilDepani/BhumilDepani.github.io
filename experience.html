										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/gsoc.png" alt="" /></span>I joined Accenture right after completing my bachelor's. At Accenture, I was working as an Artificial Intelligence Developer. During our training as freshers, the company divided new joiners into groups, and we had activities and competitions. I was the captain of my team, and I learned valuable leadership skills through this training. I participated in the Eco-Innovation Challenge, where I gave a very innovative idea. I have been heavily involved in the development of Artificial Intelligence based applications. In various projects in a company, I worked on OpenCV, cloud platform, NLP technologies. I designed an application that takes a document as an input and gives information from a document in key-value pairs. I used Image processing and NLP concepts to implement this. I won the FY21 Q4 CIO Inspire Award for this work. I also cleared the Google Cloud certification exam under one of the programs of Accenture.</p>

									<h2><a href="http://deltacontrolsys.com/"><span class="label">Delta Control System</span></a></h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/delta_control_system.jpg" alt="" /></span>I did one internship during summer vacation for two months, from 10/05/2019 to 10/07/2019. I did this internship at Delta Control System as an Embedded System Intern. I was a part of the team that was designing and developing a microcontroller-based manual and automatic door lift control system. Our primary microcontroller was the AT89S52 (8051 family). Here, my task was to design a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) for the AT89S52 microcontroller (8051 Family) and other peripheral Integrated Circuits (ICs). I have also added a Watchdog timer to increase the robustness of the software loops. Furthermore, I was responsible for writing code to add some of the newly designed features, such as Auto Attend, Emergency Landing and Fire Safety. In this internship, I got to learn the end-to-end life cycle of embedded system development. After completing an internship, I continued this project further. I tried to connect a lift system with the internet using the GSM module. This module sends statistical data about the lift operation and its health. Another team created a mobile app and a web app to visualize this data.</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/drishti.jpg" alt="" /></span>I was a member of a technical club at my university named "Drishti." I did POV Clock and Braille Printer projects at this club. During my tenure with this club, I learned about teamwork, leadership, division of project work, and how working collaboratively can make anything possible. I also coordinated the organization of many events. I also helped juniors to quickly start their learning by helping them to build a "Line Follower". I also gave a presentation and a speech on the development journey of the Braille Printer.</p>
